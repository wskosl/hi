            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>  Two siblings were born, and a year later, another sibling came along. 
              The three of them grew up close in age, sharing many things and disagreeing with a similar amount.
              As they grew older, their curiosity began to slowly rise, especially with the glowing screens that their father worked on everyday.
            </p> 
            <p> 
             Their father's passion for technology shaped the environment they were raised in. 
              Slowly but surely, all of the siblings were eventually able to use a computer. 
              It wasn't long before the siblings started asking questions about how websites worked,
              then about how games work. Eventually, there was nothing left for the father to teach.

            <h2>Main Plot</h2> 
            <p> In the 7th century, the capital moved from Yarlung to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo, who established it as the spiritual and political heart of Tibet. The Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple transformed the city into a center of governance, Buddhism, and pilgrimage. </p> 
            <p> For centuries, Lhasa was the beating heart of Tibetan life. But following Chinese occupation and the 1959 uprising, it became a place of both resistance and repression — a city where Tibetan identity remains deeply rooted, yet constantly challenged. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
            <p> After fleeing into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lama established the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. Though outside Tibet’s borders, Dharamsala has become a third symbolic capital — a refuge where culture, language, and faith continue to flourish against all odds. </p> <p> From this hillside town, generations of Tibetans in exile have preserved their identity, taught their history, and sustained a vision of return. Dharamsala stands as a global reminder that while Tibet’s land may be occupied, its spirit remains unbroken. </p>
